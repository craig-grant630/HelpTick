# HelpTick #

## Description ##

HelpTick is an easy-to-use online system that helps customers report technical problems and stay in touch with the support team until the issue is fixed. It lets users quickly create a support ticket, describe the issue in detail, and then track the progress as the engineers work on a solution. Customers get updates along the way, so they always know whatâ€™s happening with their request.

For support staff and admins, HelpTick provides a clear dashboard to manage and organize all incoming tickets. They can set priorities, assign tasks, update ticket statuses, and keep notes on how problems were resolved. Everything is designed to make communication smooth, reduce wait times, and help both customers and engineers stay on the same page from start to finish.
